## The identity model

Every account is a *slot*: a name, a provider, and an isolated CLI config
home. The provider's own login flow binds an identity (email + org/account
id) *into* that home. headroom then:

1. reads the bound identity back (via `claude auth status` / the OpenAI
   userinfo endpoint, falling back to local metadata when offline),
2. fingerprints the provider account id (SHA-256, truncated — the raw id
   never leaves the private snapshot),
3. verifies at usage-read time that the usage response belongs to the same
   fingerprint (Claude returns the organization id in a response header).

Consequences:

- a login that got clobbered (you logged into the wrong account in the wrong
  terminal) is detected and HELD, not silently mixed in;
- two slots that turn out to be the same login are both held with a
  `duplicate_identity` warning — otherwise the router would "rotate" onto
  the same exhausted quota;
- `expected_email` in config (set automatically by `headroom connect`) pins a
  slot to a specific identity permanently.

## The windows

| window | provider | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `5h` | both | rolling session window |
| `7d` | both | weekly all-models window |
| `scoped:<Model>` | Claude | weekly cap for a specific model tier (e.g. Opus) |

The dashboard and router treat *remaining* capacity (100 − used) as the
primary number. The router additionally honours provider `severity` flags and
holds anything at 100%.

## Cooldowns

A limit-hit writes `"<account>:<scope>": <reset-epoch>` into
`state/cooldowns.json`. `<scope>` is `*` for a session or weekly-all limit
(account-wide — every model family on that account is held) and a specific
model family only for a genuine model-scoped cap. The reset epoch comes from
the provider's own `resets_at` when known, else a conservative future floor
(≥15 min for a session hit, ≥6 h for a weekly hit). Cooldowns expire on their
own; `headroom clear <account>` (or `<account>:<scope>`) removes them early,
and `headroom clear` with no argument resets all.

## Session handoff (EXPERIMENTAL)

`headroom handoff` stages a verified copy of one Claude conversation transcript
in another eligible account home, writes an auditable baton to
`state/handoffs.jsonl`, and resumes with `--fork-session` from the same working
directory. The old transcript remains untouched and the target receives a new
session id. This carries conversation history only: background tasks, MCP
connections, and per-session permission approvals must be started again.

## Staleness

Routing decisions require a snapshot younger than `HEADROOM_SNAPSHOT_MAX_AGE`
(default 900s). Older snapshots trigger an inline re-collect. If collection
fails, the router *does not* fall back to the stale data — no account gets
picked on unproven capacity.

## Files

| path | perms | contents |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.headroom/config.json` | 0600 | slots + dashboard preferences |
| `~/.headroom/homes/<name>/` | provider-managed | isolated CLI credentials |
| `~/.headroom/state/usage-private.json` | 0600 | full snapshot incl. identity fingerprints |
| `~/.headroom/state/public/usage.json` | 0644 | sanitized dashboard feed |
| `~/.headroom/state/cooldowns.json` | 0600 | active cooldowns |
| `~/.headroom/state/provider-backoff.json` | 0600 | usage-endpoint 429 backoff |

## Environment overrides

Everything is overridable for testing or custom layouts: `HEADROOM_DIR`,
`HEADROOM_SNAPSHOT_MAX_AGE`, `HEADROOM_OBSERVATION_MAX_AGE`,
`HEADROOM_CLOCK_SKEW`, `HEADROOM_CODEX_STALE_AFTER`,
`HEADROOM_IDENTITY_TIMEOUT`, `HEADROOM_SERVE_MAX_AGE`, `HEADROOM_BIN_DIR`.
